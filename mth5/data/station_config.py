"""

This module contains tools for building MTH5 files from synthetic data.

Development Notes:
  - These tools are a work in progress and ideally will be able to yield
  generalize to more than just the legacy EMTF ascii datasets that they
  initially served.

Definitions used in the creation of synthetic mth5 files.

Survey level: 'mth5_path', Path to output h5

Station level: mt_metadata Station() object with station info.
  - the `id` field (name of the station) is required.
  - other station metadata can be added
  - channel_nomenclature
    - The channel_nomenclature was previously stored at the run level.  It makes more sense to store
     this info at the station level, as the only reason the nomenclature would change (that I can
     think of) would be if the acquistion system changed, in which case it would make the most
     sense to initialize a new station object.

Run level: 'columns', :channel names as a list; ["hx", "hy", "hz", "ex", "ey"]
Run level: 'raw_data_path', Path to ascii data source
Run level: 'noise_scalars', dict keyed by channel, default is zero,
Run level: 'nan_indices', iterable of integers, where to put nan [
Run level: 'filters', dict of filters keyed by columns
Run level: 'run_id', name of the run
Run level: 'sample_rate', 1.0
